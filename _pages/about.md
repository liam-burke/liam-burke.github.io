I'm a PhD student based at the Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL. My research is focused on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for automated analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, in particular for quantification of cardiac structure and function. This includes standard indices of function as well as more novel measures of deformation and motion. 

In addition to using these tools to accelerate scientific research, I'm also interested in their translation into routine clinical practice. Although important progress has been made in recent years, there is a growing need to rigorously evaluate these models and demonstrate their clinical efficacy, utility, and applicability. This will require moving to more clinically relevant criteria for model evaluation that are better adapted to the demands of healthcare and medicine. 

I'm funded by the British Heart Foundation, and supervised by Dr. Rhodri Davies (Barts Heart Centre, UCL) and Prof. Alun Hughes (UCL).
