I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL. My research is focused around developing and evaluating deep learning models for automated analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 

I'm particularly interested in how best to demonstrate a model's clinical efficacy, utility, and applicability. This will require moving to more clinically relevant criteria for model evaluation that are better adapted to the demands of healthcare and medicine. 

The overall aim of my PhD is to help facilitate the translation of these tools into routine clinical practice, and to show how they can be used to accelerate clinical and scientific research.
